I'm Kun Li, a 23-year-old first-year graduate student with a passion for academic research and technological innovation. I enjoy diving into new areas of knowledge and constantly challenging myself to learn and grow. Outside of my studies, I'm actively involved in various student organizations, which helps me broaden my horizons and connect with like-minded individuals.

My GitHub repository is a place where I share my projects and collaborate with others. I aim to continuously improve my professional skills and make meaningful contributions to the field. Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out for collaboration or discussion. Let's connect and grow together!
